# Long Path

Are you already in mid-age, locked up in loans, family duties? Are your dreams still just dreams? Where has all your energy gone? What do you have in your late 30s and what do you lack? Do you feel like your life is just about a job, salary, investments, and family needs? Do you think society cannot be changed? Do you believe that dreams are only for the rich? Why are you wasting time watching movies and short videos? What do you really want to do apart from being a money-making machine for your family?

If these questions resonate with you, then this book is for you. It is specifically tailored for working-class individuals, with a slight gender bias towards males. Although it may not address all the problems faced by females in their mid-30s, it offers practical ideas to help you recover from the challenges of mid-age and make your dreams come true.

## Unlocking Your True Potential

Imagine your body as a vehicle, driven by your mind. Who is actually in control? Just like an airplane requires maintenance, flying, landing, and earning from it, your mind is the key to unlocking both the good and the bad in your life. If you treat your mind like a young driver, preserving and nurturing it, your body will respond accordingly. It's time to embark on a journey of self-discovery.

## Key Principles to Get You Started

In this book, you will find a step-by-step plan to reclaim your mid-age and turn your dreams into reality. Here are some key principles to get you started:

1. Plan your work time: Allocate a strict 4-hour block for focused work. Divide your day into two parts: office work from 8 am to 12 pm, and a combination of learning, personal work, and some office tasks from 2 pm to 8 pm. During the latter part of the day, prioritize activities that you enjoy alongside meetings and other responsibilities.

2. Identify your blockers: Reflect on what is preventing you from achieving your goals. Is it a lack of money, job opportunities, time, or skills? Surprisingly, the biggest obstacle is often ourselves. We tend to prioritize easy distractions like watching movies, browsing online, and window shopping instead of taking action towards our dreams.

3. Embrace the 20:80 principle: Identify the 20% of activities that cause 80% of your problems. By addressing these key areas, you can significantly reduce failure and increase your chances of success.

## Holistic Practices for a Fulfilling Life

In addition to these principles, here are two important holistic practices to incorporate into your life:

1. Start with physical activity: Engage in regular exercise to boost your energy levels and improve your overall well-being. Physical activity has a profound impact on your mental clarity and productivity.

2. Diversify your work: Don't limit yourself to a single focus. Explore different areas of interest and pursue diverse projects. This not only keeps your work engaging but also opens up new opportunities for growth and learning.

Remember to approach life with the curiosity and wonder of a child. Look at each object around you differently, finding inspiration and creativity in the simplest things. And finally, don't underestimate the power of writing. Maintain a log of your thoughts, ideas, and experiences. It serves as a valuable tool for reflection and personal growth.

By following these principles and practices, you can break free from the weight of mid-age responsibilities and unlock your true potential. It's time to make your dreams a reality.

Long time, I used to feel as if big vehicles are driven by tiny humans (example: AEROPLANE). Similarly, if the body is a vehicle driven by the mind, then who is actually in control?

Humans are able to make an airplane, fly, land on ground, and earn from it. Similarly, the mind is the key to unlock any good or bad things!

Similarly, the big airplane or car is driven sportily (good speed) by the human in it. If the mind is preserved and treated like a young driver, the body will also behave accordingly. So, let's discover ourselves!

Follow this book. I am going to have practical ideas to recover your mid-age and make your dreams come true.

"My Dream -
Arbyte Technologies with 100 working full-time employees"
Arbyte Factories - Creating wonderful energy-saving and farming equipment, innovations for all walks of life"

This is my journey from day one!

- Plan your work time (4 hours of strict working time)
  (8 am to 12 pm - office work)
  (2 pm to 8 pm) - Focus on learning and personal work, along with mild office work.

  From 2 pm to 8 pm, 100% office work is not there. Do what you like along with meetings and other stuff.

- What do you think is blocking you from achieving what you need?
  a. Money
  b. Job
  c. Lack of time?
  d. Lack of skill?

- The hardest fact found while interacting with relatives and people around me:
"We are our own biggest blocking factors to achieve our dreams."
Do you know why?
Easy to watch movies
Easy to browse on Amazon
Easy to browse on things you wanted online, just window shopping.

The hardest problem with the new generation of people:
"Wearing a mask around you, like a helmet with 10 kgs of weight."
1 kg - current work (for me, office work)
1 kg - part story of the last seen web series in mind
1 kg - dreams - plain dreams without action and deep breath about what could have been done in my life.

1000 kgs of problems, we can list, different for different people. We all are easy in telling reasons.
