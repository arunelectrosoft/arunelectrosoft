Are you already in mid age, locked up in loans, family duties ?

Are your dreams are still a dream only?

where all the energy in you gone ?

What you have in late 30s and what you donot ?

Already feeling like job, salary, invesment, family needs - end of life ?

Feeling society cannot be changed, the way it works ?

Dreams are only for rich people to make it come true ?

Then read this book, this is book is for working class people. 

Mostly Gender Biased - For Male. 
Not sure of all female problems in mid of 30s. 


Long time, i used to feel as if Big vehicles are driven by tiny humans ( example: AEROPLANE)
similarly,  If body is a vehicle, driven by mind, then who is actually in control ?

Human has to maintain Aeroplane, flies it, lands it, maintain it. earn out of it. 
Similarly Mind is the key to unlock any good or bad things !!

Similarly the big Aeroplane or Car, is driven sportily (good speed) by the human in it, 
if mind is preserved and treated like a young driver, body will also behave likely. 
so, lets discover our self !!


Follow this book. I am going to have practical ideas to recover your mid age to 
make your dreams come true. 

"My Dream - 
Arbyte Technologies with 100 working full time employees"
Arbyte Factories - Creating wonderful energy saving and farming equippments, innovations for all walks of life"

This is my journey from day one !!

- Plan your work time ( 4 hours of strict working time)
  (8 am to 12 pm - office work ) 
  (2 pm to 8 pm ) - Learning and personal work, along with mild office work. 
  
  From my 2 pm 8 pm , 100% office work is not there. 
  Do what u like along with meeting and other stuff. 
  
  
- What do you think, blocking you from achieving what you need ?
  a. Money
  b. Job
  c. Lack of time ?
  d. Lack of skill ?
  
- Hardest fact , found While interacting with relatives and people around me 
 "We are our own biggest blocking factors to achieve our dreams "
 Do you know, why ?
 Easy to watch movies
 Easy to browse on amazon
 Easy to browse on things you wanted on online, just windows shopping. 
 
 Hardest Problem with new generation of people:
 "Wearing a mask around you, like a helmet with 10 kgs of weight "
 1 kg - current work ( for me office work )
 1 kg - part story of last seen web series in mind 
 1 kg - dreams - plain dream without action and deep breath about what could have been done in my life. 
 1 kg - why i am here, trying to find reasons for my failures - "part family"
 1 kg - if i had right talent, friends, i would have been a better
 1 kg - if my parents supported me, i would have been better
 1 kg - if my first love is succeedded, i would not have sorrows.
 1 kg - what to do for pending work
 1 kg - how to convince my parents to be trendy or the way i like
 1 kg - while single, how to mingle with people. 
 
 1000 kgs of problem, we can list, differnt for different person. we all are easy in telling reasons.
